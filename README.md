## TDD Modules

### Creating Deck - Christy
This TDD module is designed to generate a balanced deck that has exactly 1 random hero card and 9 other random non-hero cards for the card game we will be creating in the IDSP project. I have also created a fake cards database for the function to work with each card having a name, element, power, cardClass, and effects. Tests were created to ensure that generated decks will have exactly 1 hero card and will return a different set of deck in each call.
